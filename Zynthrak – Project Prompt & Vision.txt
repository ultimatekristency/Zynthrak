# 🧠 Zynthrak – **Project Prompt & Vision (Updated)**  
*For Continuation & Execution*

---

## 🎯 **Project Vision**

**Zynthrak** is a **decentralized, self-updating peer-to-peer (P2P) network**, built for seamless communication, coordination, and update propagation. Each **Zynthrak Node** operates as a headless, lightweight background process that connects with other peers using a **Gossip Protocol** to maintain network cohesion.

A central **Bootstrap Server** exists solely to assist with **initial peer discovery** and **update metadata distribution**. The **Zynthrak Prime** acts as the **update coordinator** and monitoring console, ensuring reliable propagation of signed updates across the network.

Zynthrak is **stateless at runtime**, and **ephemeral by design** — nodes do not persist peer data but instead dynamically rejoin and reconnect when online, ensuring a resilient and flexible system.

## 🧩 **Project Goals**

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🛰️ P2P Communication | Achieve decentralized communication using **Gossip Protocol** for peer discovery and network health. |
| 🧬 Update Coordination | Let **Zynthrak Prime** control update rollout using metadata from the Bootstrap Server. |
| 🔁 Self-Updating | Ensure nodes autonomously apply verified updates, improving over time. |
| 🌐 Global Scalability | Handle wide-scale node deployments and synchronization without central reliance. |
| 🔒 Security & Integrity | Leverage **encryption + digital signatures** for all communication and update validation. |
| 🛠️ Background Operation | All nodes are **silent processes**. Only Zynthrak Prime has a user interface (console-based). |

## 💻 **Technologies Stack**

### 🔷 **1. Actix Web (Rust)**
- **Role**: Bootstrap Server API
- **Why?**
  - High performance for concurrent requests.
  - Built-in TLS support.
  - Asynchronous + secure by design.

---

### 🦀 **2. Rust (Clients & Nodes)**
- **Role**: Zynthrak Node & Prime software
- **Why?**
  - Memory-safe + performant.
  - Great for networking, system-level control.
  - Native concurrency with `async/await`.

---

### 📡 **3. Gossip Protocol**
- **Role**: P2P network communication and synchronization
- **Why?**
  - Scalable and fault-tolerant.
  - Fully decentralized peer discovery.
  - Redundant information propagation.

---

### 🔐 **4. HTTPS + Encryption**
- **Role**: All Bootstrap communications & GitHub API requests
- **Why?**
  - Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - Ensures secure peer metadata transmission.

---

### ✍️ **5. Digital Signatures**
- **Role**: Validating updates
- **Why?**
  - Verifies update authenticity.
  - Guarantees update content integrity.

---

### 📦 **6. GitHub Releases**
- **Role**: Hosting versioned node update binaries
- **Why?**
  - Clean distribution model.
  - Version control + public access.
  - Reliable and scalable hosting.

---

## 🔧 **Project Phases**

### 🟩 **Phase 1: Bootstrap Server**
- [x] Implement basic REST API using **Actix Web**
- [x] Allow node registration (`POST /api/register`)
- [ ] Serve signed update metadata (`GET /api/update`)
- [ ] TLS support
- [ ] In-memory storage of connected nodes

---

### 🟨 **Phase 2: Zynthrak Prime**
- [ ] Connects to Bootstrap API for metadata
- [ ] Downloads update from GitHub Release
- [ ] Verifies digital signature
- [ ] Pushes update to connected nodes
- [ ] CLI interface for monitoring and control

---

### 🟨 **Phase 3: Zynthrak Node Clients**
- [x] Startup: register with bootstrap, fetch peers
- [ ] Maintain memory-only peer list
- [ ] Attempt TCP/QUIC connections to peers
- [ ] Receive updates, validate, apply
- [ ] Periodically re-discover peers

---

### 🟦 **Phase 4: Gossip Protocol**
- [ ] Implement heartbeat messages
- [ ] Share peer list with other nodes
- [ ] Resilient reconnection and discovery loop
- [ ] Custom protocol for update propagation

---

### 🟥 **Phase 5: Scaling & Deployment**
- [ ] Simulate 100+ node mesh
- [ ] Global latency + packet loss testing
- [ ] CPU/memory profiling
- [ ] Graceful node restarts and rejoining

---

## 🌍 **Operational Principles**

| Concept | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Stateless | Nodes don’t store peers on disk — they rediscover on boot |
| Always Connected | Nodes periodically gossip and rejoin as needed |
| Volatile | Node state may be lost — but the network always heals |
| No UI | All nodes are CLI-based or daemonized — Prime node has terminal dashboard |
| GitHub Host | Updates are hosted using GitHub Releases |
| P2P Secure | All gossip communication is encrypted |

---

## 🔐 **Security Summary**

| Feature | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ HTTPS | For all external communication (Bootstrap, GitHub) |
| ✅ Digital Signatures | Prime signs each update, nodes validate before install |
| ✅ Encrypted Traffic | Peer-to-peer messages are encrypted (via TLS or key exchange) |
| ✅ Update Rollback Protection | Signature includes version metadata |
| ✅ Runtime Hardening | Only known peers allowed by trust rules (future) |

---

## 📌 **What Happens on Node Boot?**

1. Generate unique ID (`UUID` or hardware ID)
2. Register with Bootstrap Server
3. Receive list of available peers
4. Connect to known peers
5. Periodically send `heartbeat` messages
6. Check for updates
7. Apply updates (if valid signature)

---

## ✅ Summary

Zynthrak blends **peer-to-peer networking** with a **secure, updatable node system** that requires no central authority to function — only to initiate. Nodes act as semi-autonomous agents in a decentralized mesh, and the entire system can operate efficiently at scale, with robustness to disconnection, failure, or downtime.
